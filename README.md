# pub-quiz-nodejs

This is a fun project for me to learn NodeJs.

The premise of this software is a website where pub-quizes can be managed:
At this stage it is meant for the quiz manager:
- Set up a new quiz by selecting the number of teams and name them
- Start a new round with questions
- Finish a round by giving points to each team
- Finalize a quiz and show a leaderboard

## How to run
`npm install`
I'm using nodemon to run my app:
`nodemon app`
but if you just want to see the results the following should suffice:
`npm run app`

#### This is only meant for me to learn NodeJS
