# pub-quiz-nodejs

This is a fun project for me to learn NodeJs.

The premise of this software is a backend website where pub-quizes can be managed:
- There's an API point for participants to send their answers
- There are multiple API points for the quiz manager to administrate the quiz
  - Delete all data (i.e. before starting a new quiz)
  - Mark answers as right / wrong
  - Get a summary of a quiz: which teams scored what

## don't actually use this idea
If nothing else, allowing internet usage to your pub-quiz participants will make it very easy to cheat.
It's also taking away some of the fun of playing in a social setting.

#### This is only meant for me to learn NodeJS, nothing more.
